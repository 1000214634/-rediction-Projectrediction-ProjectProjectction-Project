Churn Analysis Project

This project encompasses a comprehensive Churn Analysis using SQL Server, Power BI, and Python. The project covers the following topics:

    1.ETL Process in SQL Server: Extract, Transform, Load processes to handle data efficiently.
    2.Data Cleaning in SQL Server: Techniques to clean and prepare data for analysis.
    3.Power BI Transformations: Data transformation techniques in Power BI for better visualization.
    4.Power BI Visualization & Enhancing Visuals: Creating and enhancing visualizations in Power BI.
    5.Building a Machine Learning Model - Random Forest in Jupyter Notebook: Implementing a Random Forest model to predict churn.
    6.Visualizing Predicted Data in Power BI - Predicted Churner Profile: Displaying the profile of predicted churners using Power BI visualizations.


    Tools and Technologies Used:

    -SQL Server: For ETL processes and data cleaning.
    -Power BI: For data transformation and creating visualizations.
    -Python (Jupyter Notebook): For building the machine learning model using Random Forest.

    Project Components

    -SQL Scripts: Contains SQL scripts for ETL processes, data cleaning, and preparation.
    -Power BI Files: Includes Power BI Desktop files with data transformations, visualizations, and dashboards.
    -Jupyter Notebooks: Python notebooks for training the Random Forest model and generating predictions.
    -Data: Sample datasets used for analysis (ensure no sensitive information is included).
